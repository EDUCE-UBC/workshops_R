You need to install and test R and RStudio before the workshop.
Installation process is simple on all major platforms, and mostly
consists of downloading and running the installers appropriate to your
platform. Please contact the instructors if you run into difficulties
so we can help you show up with a computer properly set up for the
workshop.


## R and RStudio

* Download and install [R, a free software environment for statistical
  computing and graphics](http://www.r-project.org) from
  [CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com), the Comprehensive R Archive
  Network. It is _highly recommended_ to install a precompiled binary
  distribution for your operating system -- use the links up at the
  top of the CRAN page linked to above!
  
  > If you currently have R installed on your laptop please make sure
  > it is version 3.2.0 or later (current release is 3.5.0). **Please
  > update if it is not!**
 
* [Install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), a powerful user interface for R.

## Testing testing

* Do whatever is appropriate for your OS to launch RStudio. You should
  get a window similar to the screenshot below.

  If you don't see a window that is divided into distinct areas
  labelled "Console", "Environment", etc., you are probably running
  the user interface that comes bundled with R. Check that RStudio is
  present in your applications and start it instead.
  
* Put your cursor in the pane labelled "Console", which is where you
  interact with the live R process. Create a simple object with code
  like `x <- 2 * 4` (followed by enter or return). In the
  "Environment" pane, to the right of the Console, you should see an
  entry for "x" with appropriate value (in this case, 8).
  
* Then inspect the `x` object by typing `x` in the Console followed by
  enter or return. Obviously you should see the value 8 print to
  screen.

* Finally, check that plotting works. In the console, type
  `plot(cars)`. If you see a scatterplot appear in the "Plots" pane,
  you are good to go.
