# Workshops
Notes, scripts, and exercises for data science workshops put on through ECOSCOPE (http://ecoscope.ubc.ca/)

## Introduction to R and RStudio
Coming soon!

## Introduction to the tidyverse
In this workshop, we provide a brief introduction to RStudio, then delve into data manipulation and graphics in the tidyverse including the packages dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2. We teach different ways to manipulate data in tabular and text forms as well as the critical concepts underlying the grammar of graphics and how they are implemented in ggplot. We will use RStudio, a powerful but user-friendly R environment, and teach you how to use it effectively.

You will learn how to :

* create an R project and import data from a file into R,
* create subsets of rows or columns from data frames using dplyr,
* select pieces of an object by indexing using element names or position,
* change your data frames between wide and narrow formats,
* create various types of graphics,
* modify the various features of a graphic, and
* save your graphic in various formats

## Reproducible research in R and Git
Coming soon!

## Statistical models in R
Coming soon!
