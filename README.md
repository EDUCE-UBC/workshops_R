Notes, scripts, and exercises for data science workshops through ECOSCOPE (http://ecoscope.ubc.ca/)

## The data
The data in these workshops were collected as part of an on-going oceanographic time series program in Saanich Inlet, a seasonally anoxic fjord on the East coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia (Figure 1). We use data from various geochemical measurements at many depths in Saanich Inlet over time (approximately monthly from 2006 to 2014) as well as microbial data from selected time frames and depths of interest.

Saanich Inlet is a steep sided fjord characterized by a shallow glacial sill located at the mouth of the inlet that restricts circulation in basin waters below 100 m (Figure 2).

**Figure 2.** Structure of Saanich Inlet. The glacial sill restricts water circulation into and out of the lower depth of the inlet basin.

During spring and summer months, elevated primary production (like photosynthesis) in surface waters combined with restricted circulation results in progressive water column stratification and complete oxygen starvation (anoxia) in deep basin waters. In late summer, pulses of oxygenated nutrient-rich ocean waters upwelling from the Haro Straight cascade over the sill, displacing oxygen starved bottom waters upward. The intensity of these renewal events varies from year to year with implications for microbial ecology and biogeochemical cycles (Figure 3).

**Figure 3.** Contour plot of water column oxygen concentrations over multiple years in the time series. Warmer colors indicate high oxygen concentrations while cooler colors are low. Note the recurring pattern of oxygen decline below 100 m depth intervals followed by seasonal renewal events in late Summer into early Fall carrying more oxygenated waters into the Inlet. 

The seasonal cycle of stratification and deep water renewal enables spatial and temporal profiling across a wide range of water column energy states and nutrients, thus making Saanich Inlet a model ecosystem for studying microbial community responses to ocean deoxygenation. Ocean deoxygenation is a widespread phenomenon currently increasing due to climate change.

## Introduction to R (2hr)

This is a truly introductory workshop for beginners with no experience in R. In this workshop, we introduce you to R and RStudio at the beginner level. This condensed 2-hour workshop is meant to get you started in R and acts as a pre-requisite for our more advanced workshops. In it, we cover:

* R and RStudio
* RStudio projects
* R scripts
* Installing packages
* Reading in data as a data frame
* Vectors, single values, and data types
* Basic data visualization
* The help function

We recommend this workshop be given across a single 2 hour session.

## Introduction to the tidyverse
In this workshop, we provide a brief introduction to RStudio, then delve into data manipulation and graphics in the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) including the packages dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2. We teach different ways to manipulate data in tabular and text forms as well as the critical concepts underlying the grammar of graphics and how they are implemented in ggplot. We will use RStudio, a powerful but user-friendly R environment, and teach you how to use it effectively.

You will learn how to :

* create an R project and import data from a file into R,
* create subsets of rows or columns from data frames using dplyr,
* select pieces of an object by indexing using element names or position,
* change your data frames between wide and narrow formats,
* create various types of graphics,
* modify the various features of a graphic, and
* save your graphic in various formats

We recommend this workshop be given across 6 hours as 3 x 2 hour sessions. Participants with little to no prior experience should consider taking or reviewing our "Introduction to R" workshop prior to this tidyverse series.

## Reproducible research

In this workshop, we introduce computational reproducibility and its importance to modern research. We will teach the general principles for reproducible computer-based analyses, along with specific methods and tools for reproducibility and version control with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).

You will learn how to:

* Construct reproducible, automatable workflows in R with scripts and Make
* Create reproducible documents using Rmarkdown to include underlying code / computations with relevant graphical and statistical results in several different formats (reports, presentation slides, handouts, notes)
* Use Git version control
* Integrate version control with GitHub for both personal and group projects

We recommend this workshop be given across 6 hours as 3 x 2 hour sessions. Participants with little to no prior experience should consider taking or reviewing our "Introduction to R" workshop prior to this series.
